We're small (~30 people), which means we can stay close to our clients and develop and improve our products very quickly to meet their needs. It also means you'll get great exposure to all of the things that go on in a fast growing business, and have a chance to have a big impact very quickly. We're also quite a close-knit team, so we're keen to find somebody with good social skills who would enjoy and thrive in this environment.</p><p>We’re looking for a junior back end web developer to join our growing development team. Development deals with expanding the functionality of Firefly, as well as providing support for the existing areas of the product. Previous experience in real world web development; familiarity with databases, mobile development and other school systems are helpful but not necessary.</p><p>We're looking for someone who is:</p><p></p><pre><code>    • A keen and efficient problem solver
    • Independent in their work
    • Able to locate and fix problems in existing code
    • A good team player to work with other members of the team and work alongside
      our support team when necessary
    • Good with time management
    • Happy to take on responsibilities
    • A logical thinker
    • A good communicator – within the team and with other areas of the business
</code></pre>
Knowledge of any of these would also help:<p></p><pre><code>    • Microsoft development technologies (especially C# and ASP.NET)
    • Mobile app development (iOS or Android)
    • Linux, PHP and scripting
    • Experience in the education sector
</code></pre>
Most importantly, we're looking for someone friendly, enthusiastic and good at picking up new skills quickly.<p>Salary would be competitive and depend on experience. All of the Firefly team also participate in a yearly bonus scheme based on the success of the business and their contribution. We're committed to your own professional development, so we offer a flexible training budget for you to spend on attending courses or other events.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">Apply online at <a href="http://fireflysolutions.co.uk/join-our-team/jobs/junior-developer" rel="nofollow">http://fireflysolutions.co.uk/join-our-team/jobs/junior-deve...</a> or please drop me an e-mail with any questions at robin+hn1406@fireflysolutions.co.uk.</font></p><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./index_files/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7852015" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7852015&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%38%32%39%30%34%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7852015"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=notarockstar">notarockstar</a> 19 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7852015">link</a></span></div><br>

More importantly, you’ll be working around a team of 24 smart, talented people (9 engineers) who are all equally committed to solving this particular problem.</p><p>We’re always pushing each other to learn new things, both technical and nontechnical - in the past few weeks we’ve done collaborative tech talks on things like:</p><p>-exoplanets</p><p>-kitesurfing</p><p>-Magic: the Gathering</p><p>-Regular Expressions for Regular People</p><p>(We also play a lot of bughouse chess.)</p></font><p><font color="#000000">We’re looking for full-stack engineers who can hack in Node, Go, and Python (or are willing to learn), but more importantly, we’re looking for people who share our passion for improving education.

We're a financial media company, a poor man's - lest we say everyday man's - Bloomberg competitor, and a financial product SaaS all forged together into a powerful trident that is attacking the high seas of Wall Street in a relentless pursuit of transparency.<p>And conquer we shall! We've grown 100% quarter over quarter all last year and another 100% just in the last month. Our team has surged to 30+ people and the waves of revenue washed together to form a rushing roar with just one of our products going from nothing to $200k/month in under a year.</p><p>Being a media company we find our way into all kinds of cool stuff. Our office is furnished with things like a $3000 high-end bed that was sent to us to review. We got to talk to and get pictures with Warren Buffett and Lloyd Blankfein (CEO of Goldman Sachs) when they came to Detroit.</p><p>But, you interject, finance is one of the toughest startup seas to sail upon! The old boys club runs an ironclad ship with no visible decks for boarding. Avast! We've built a battering ram of a business in just a few short years that has pummeled its way deep into the heart of Wall Street. Old Ironsides has warmed itself to Benzinga and once a taste the thirst cannot be quenched.</p><p>We've recently became Microsoft's premier finance partner alongside 3 other companies, all worth over a billion dollars and established for years. As of this Christmas we were installed by default on 500 million desktops and tablets via Windows 8 Finance. No download necessary. That's right mateys, we're in the source code.</p><p>And if you happen to trade or invest yourself you'll find us inside almost all of the major brokerages in the US.</p><p>So, where do you fit in this rigging, you swashbuckling scalawag? Well, our team is crazy ambitious, motivated, and experienced with shaking shit up. If you know your tech, and want on deck this is the place to do it. Your exact technical background and language of choice doesn't matter as much as your motivation and your ability to adapt quickly.</p><p>We are a young team and we're especially looking for sailors who've got some salt in their whiskers who can help us scale from millions to hundreds of millions.</p><p>Why be a ninja when you can be a pirate?

Our popular flagship app for iOS and Android provides an easy way for consumers to manage &amp; track all of their purchases and even save money with price drop alerts.</font></p><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./index_files/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7830856" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7830856&dir=up&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%38%32%39%30%34%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7830856"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=uxp">uxp</a> 23 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7830856">link</a></span></div><br>

Engineering is the department that drives our apps, tools, data, and interfaces forward. This attitude comes not only from the Engineers, but from our CEO and other top management. They believe in us.</p><p>We have awesome problems to solve.</p><p>The housing market provides a fantastic blend of problems.  We need creative people to help us combine the data about every address in America with the soft side of helping people find a home that makes them feel safe, happy, and comfortable.</p><p>Stability is wonderful.</p><p>We're that rare company that holds the culture of its startup roots, while blending in the sanity of a regular work schedule with an emphasis on work/life/family balance.</p><p>You:</p><p>- You have experience working on high-traffic, scalable internet applications
- You love solving hard problems and working in small teams with smart people
- You're comfortable with everything from bash scripting to javascript
- You're a great person
- You love making fast websites</p><p>What you'll work with:</p><p>Our base web stack is LAMP, but that rides on top of Solr/Lucene, Hadoop, Memcache, Python, Couchbase, Open Street Maps, and more.  We’re rewriting our website to use Javascript on both client and server using Rendr.js, Node.js and Backbone.js.  We use jQuery on the client, d3.js and Raphel.js for our charts and Git for source control. We're learning OOCSS and are folding SASS into our workflow as well. If there's something that's a good idea for the team, we'll do our best to implement it.</p><p>How we work:</p><p>The engineering team is about a hundred people, and we break into small teams of 2-4 to focus on specific projects.  The rentals team is a small, vertically-integrated team within the larger engineering team.  We are responsible for the entire Trulia Rentals product, giving us the speed and flexibility of a startup with the resources of a public company.</p><p>We release weekly, but new features are always under development and often span releases. Our local QA team writes automation tests and does hand testing of your features, working with you to ensure that only high quality code gets to production. Organizationally, we're pretty flat, though you'll have a mentor with whom you'll have weekly 1-on-1 meetings, to review code, exchange ideas, and ensure we're doing everything we can for you to thrive in your role.</p><p>Behind the curtain:
- 'Innovation Week' every quarter
- People you're happy to see every day
- Stocked Kitchens and two kegerators
- Unbeatable SOMA location with penthouse roof deck
- All IDEs welcome
- Aeron chairs
- Great benefits (untracked time off, variety of health plans, 401k match)</p><p>Trulia is a successful rapidly growing Internet technology company, redefining the home search experience for consumers and changing the way real estate professionals build their businesses.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">MindTribe - San Francisco, CA<p>We make hardware. We’re looking for senior firmware engineers to join the team!</p><p>The hard requirements are brief: 5+ years of writing code for embedded systems with experience leading projects. At Mindtribe we code most often in C. In addition to technical work, our senior engineers plan projects, lead teams of engineers, and mentor junior members.</p><p>At this point, you can tackle most technical challenges that come your way. The rest you could figure out given enough time. You’re starting to grow into someone who can elevate an entire team – not just by adding engineering horsepower, but by multiplying the abilities of those around you. You could probably get a job anywhere you want. Why Mindtribe?</p><p>As a product development consultancy, we get to peek inside a lot of exciting companies. That’s how we know there’s nowhere else we’d rather be.</p><p>Nobody sees the kind of variety that we do. Working at Mindtribe is being immersed in a constant stream of projects across different industries using different technologies. You will learn. A lot. About everything. Mindtribers are not just versatile within their own fields – “firmware” engineers work with everything from 8-bit micros to embedded Linux to smartphones – we also have EE’s driving SolidWorks, ME’s developing iOS apps, and FW engineers laying out PCB’s. You’ll iterate through many careers-worth of projects and solutions faster than you thought possible. And you’ll get better at it each time.</p><p>Everyone here loves hardware, so much that we’ve been known to spend leisure time on projects that aren’t so different from what we do at work. Or perhaps it’s the other way around. We may code in bits and bytes, but we work in the real world. Our desks are cluttered with dev boards and prototypes. We work shoulder-to-shoulder with teammates, discuss our work throughout each day, and build amazing things together. We’re constantly in front of clients to extract feedback, plot course corrections, and lead the way.</p><p>Mindtribe succeeds by putting forward strong teams with sound methods. While we consider ourselves talented engineers, relying on heroic individual efforts to meet impossible deadlines is a painful way to squeak by. Instead, our edge comes from constant introspection about how we do engineering, and we are always looking for ways to improve. Things that are broken here don’t stay that way for long.</p><p>We’re a small company. As a result, your contributions will have immediate, visible impacts not just on projects, but also on the success of the entire organization. Although we all swab the decks, everyone also gets to help steer.</p><p>Mindtribe is located in the heart of downtown San Francisco, convenient to public transit and at the epicenter of a flourishing technology industry. We enjoy working together and place great value in maintaining an awesome company environment. ‘Tribers regularly spend time together outside the office, whether that’s doing happy hour at a local watering hole or enjoying the rocking chairs at the new Exploratorium.</p><p>For more information about us, check out our team (<a href="http://www.mindtribe.com/team" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindtribe.com/team</a>), our portfolio (<a href="http://www.mindtribe.com/portfolio" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindtribe.com/portfolio</a>), and our method (<a href="http://www.mindtribe.com/method" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindtribe.com/method</a>).</p></font><p><font color="#000000">If this is resonating, we’d love to get to know you!

If you love designing and building modern, responsive web applications that make it easy for business users to run sophisticated investment analysis software, we would like to talk to you. We’re an established company with actual paying customers and we want to make our little corner of the world a better place for our users.<p>We use standards-based HTML, JavaScript and CSS to build a cross-browser UI. We use a lot of state of the art technology – HTML5, canvas, RequireJS, Backbone, LESS and node.js. The backend is a mixture of C#, Java, C++ because we believe in using the right tool for the job, and we are regularly evaluating our tools to ensure that. Our development process is agile and we release our web products approximately once a month.</p><p>Our offices are a five minute walk from the Nevada shore of Lake Tahoe and Heavenly ski resort is a fifteen minute drive from the office. As a developer you’ll also get your own private office and even though we mostly develop on Windows, all our developers have Mac hardware.
We prefer to hire generalists who are as curious and excited about technology as we are. All of us enjoy learning new technologies and tools; we have a small team and each developer should be able to work on every aspect of the system.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">Please note: this is a full-time, on-site position.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Backend/Frontend Developers - Mirus Research - Bloomington, IL - onsite.<p>We're a small, established company that does B2B and Enterprise-level software. We have 10 employees and 4 of us are full-time devs. We work in whatever tools are productive and pleasant to use (historically we've used Python, Node, Clojure on the backend, and we're just figuring out how to make good use of the new-hawtness frontend tools like Knockout/React/etc.). We're not afraid of experimenting with new stuff, but we tend to favor tried and true solutions, so working with Django, Postgres, and JQuery should not make you want to claw your eyes out.</p><p>We're looking for both backend and frontend developers who are willing to relocate to a family-friendly college town in the Midwest. We have a wide tolerance for your experience level, PLEASE get in touch if you're interested. (don@mirusresearch.com)</p><p>We have a lot of the startup-style environment (chef-prepped lunch once a week, massage therapist once a month, couches, ping-pong, macbooks, trendy office, etc.) without the stress of worrying whether you'll be on the streets in a month. Also, we're not a frat house, so if the keg-in-the-office or brogrammer scenes aren't really your thing, you won't have to worry about that here.</p><p>Unfortunately, at the present time we are only able to hire folks who are legally able to work in the US.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">Email me: don@mirusresearch.com</font></p><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr style="height:10px"></tr><tr><td class="title"><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/index2.html" rel="nofollow">More</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>

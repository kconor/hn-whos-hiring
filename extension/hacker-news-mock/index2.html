<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Rainforest QA, San Francisco, CA (but open to remote employees)<p>Additional info:
<a href="https://www.rainforestqa.com/jobs/" rel="nofollow">https://www.rainforestqa.com/jobs/</a></p><p>FULL STACK ENGINEER</p><p>Are you an experienced web-software hacker? If you have worked on a production web site with meaningful traffic and customers, know at least 3 programming languages and are comfortable writing unit tests then we want to talk to you.</p><p>Are you opinionated and diplomatic? Most people are one or the other. All major decisions are made democratically, and we do code reviews on every pull request to keep quality high. You need to be able to express your opinions in as objective a manner as possible, and be able to accept and learn from constructive criticism. There's always a better way to do something.</p><p>Are you working on personal projects / your own startup? You'll need to be a self-starter to get on at Rainforest, because we'll give you a lot of freedom and almost no hand-holding.</p><p>DESIGNERS WHO CODE</p><p>Design is at the heart of everything we do. We fundamentally believe that great design - meaning usability, simplicity and elegance - is core to our competitive advantage, and one of the most important ways we can work toward our mission of making developers happier and more productive.</p><p>We are proponents of noPSD design (so much so that we wrote a blog post about our process). To that end you should at the very least be comfortable with mocking up your designs in HTML and CSS, and ideally be able to own the entire front-end process of shipping a new feature, from conception through user research, to design and build, and iterating based on usage metrics and qualitative feedback.</p><p>We know we're looking for a unicorn, so if you feel like you're an excellent front-end hacker whose design chops are a bit rusty you should still get in touch. Design is all about iteration, and we already have a great designer on our team who can help you grow as a designer.</p><p>DEV OPS</p><p>We're looking for an exceptional DevOps engineer to join as the next member of Rainforest. We're still a very small team, but people usually think we're much bigger given the scale at which we operate.</p><p>One of the more technically complex parts of our infrastructure is managing a large stack of virtual machines. Every single test run through Rainforest is done through a newly minted VM. This means that we boot thousands of machines every single day. Given our current growth, we expect this to grow exponentially.</p><p>Here's what we hope to get out of you: You're not afraid of writing code, our stack is Ruby, so you'll have to either know it or be ready to learn it. You need to have prior experience with a provisioning tool (Puppet, Chef, etc). You understand systems and networks thoroughly. You know things we don't about distributed systems.</p><p>We're working on super hard problems that make developers' lives easier. We are a group of friends that love what we're working on, and believe that we're going to change the world for people building software.</p><p>DATA NERD</p><p>We run a lot of tests here at Rainforest. We record everything that testers do to execute each test. Clicks, text entry, submission times, answers, screenshots… everything. Alongside that, we have fine-grained metrics on our testers, where they are from, what time they log into the system, how often they test with Rainforest. That's a lot of data and we could do so much more with it.</p><p>We're looking for someone to help us do that. Your role will be to use this data to improve the quality of the results we return to our customers, detect fraud, resolve disputes, generate tests automatically and many many other things.</p><p>We're looking for someone with a strong background in data science, statistics and supervised learning. You'll also need to be able to write code to productize your work. Most importantly, you should be able to own your projects and see them through to improving the lives of our customers. This role would probably be perfect for academics who want to get into a small team that moves fast and ships software every day.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">Apply via our website! <a href="https://www.rainforestqa.com/jobs/" rel="nofollow">https://www.rainforestqa.com/jobs/</a></font></p><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./index2_files/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7829563" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7829563&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%76%4c%38%48%61%4a%76%59%33%48%73%4a%73%63%77%49%35%37%70%33%78%48"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7829563"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=biggitybones">biggitybones</a> 23 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7829563">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Scribd (YC '06), San Francisco - H1B, FULL-TIME, and INTERN are all welcome
Scribd ("Netflix for eBooks", top 100 website, 50 people) is hiring talented hackers of all kinds to help us build the library of the 21st century.
We've hired SEVEN full-time people and TONS of interns from these "Who is Hiring" threads ... it really works! We're looking for people who want to work with:<p></p><pre><code>  *   Ruby on Rails (we're the #2 largest rails site, after Twitter)
  *   Javascript (well, we use Coffeescript)
  *   iOS OR Android (we're a top 10 eBook app, with a tiny mobile team)
  *   Machine Learning / data mining / recommendations - think Netflix prize, but for books!
  *   Internships: junior standing or above for all areas of engineering. 

</code></pre>
That said, we care way more about your personality and general hacking skills then what languages you've used so far, so if you haven't used these but want to break into mobile or web development, this could be a good opportunity for you. We've hired people from these threads with everywhere from 0 to 10 years of experience.<p>We're profitable, very well funded and have a really fun office environment (go-karts + a rock climbing wall!).
Scribd alumni have gone on to found 4 other YCombinator companies, more than from any other startup. We think this says something about the kind of people that we like to hire, and we love hiring people with entrepreneur and startup ambitions.</p><p>We are also always looking for international people interested in moving to the US and can help you secure a visa.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">We recently launched a service that's being called the "Netflix for books" and are really excited about it.

A front-end engineer that has a strong computer science background, but wants to focus on product engineering rather than backend systems. You don’t want to just take off the shelf UI components, but want to explore new interactions. You aren’t afraid to dig under the hood of iOS frameworks or browser code in order to make an animation or interaction feel natural and smooth.</p><p>=============</p><p>Backend Engineer at Prismatic: <a href="http://boards.greenhouse.io/prismatic/jobs/5976" rel="nofollow">http://boards.greenhouse.io/prismatic/jobs/5976</a></p><p>==</p></font><p><font color="#000000">Prismatic is a great place to be a backend engineer - we analyze millions of shared web pages every day, automatically classify them into tens of thousands of topics, and serve up personalized feeds in real-time using our homegrown, lightning fast, machine learning-based relevance engine. We are looking to grow our top-notch team, with both junior and senior-level positions available.
We are looking for engineers with deep interest and knowledge in at least one area core to our business (i.e., distributed systems, ops and tooling, machine learning, designing and building new product features). We’re a small team, so you will have the opportunity to have a lot of impact, and to learn from peers who are extremely talented engineers, computer scientists, and data experts. Our backend is written entirely in Clojure, a JVM-based LISP that is a dream to work in. Almost none of us knew it before we joined, and we don’t expect you to either. We do, however, expect the following:
- You live and die by good abstractions. You know that they can make the difference between easily understandable and maintainable code, and a spaghetti mess. - You think about edge cases and performance implications, and anticipate future needs. - You read and understand existing code before diving in and adding your own. You re-use existing code whenever possible, cleaning it up as needed to be more generally useful. - You know when to do it fast, when to do it right, and how to find the best compromise between the two. - You recognize that we are all stewards of the codebase, not owners. You leave code better than you found it, and you fix bugs without grumbling about whose they are. - You are a team player who enjoys discussing ideas and implementations with other engineers.
Here’s a small sampling of the things you will be working on as a member of the Prismatic backend team:
- Making our crawlers and document analysis better and more comprehensive - Building out new product features in our API - Solving tough systems problems to help us scale reliably and robustly - Building and improving Machine Learning systems for ranking, document analysis, and more - Creating tools to assist development and ops - Shipping some of the best open-source Clojure libraries out there, and working with the community to make them better</font></p><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./index2_files/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7830140" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7830140&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%76%4c%38%48%61%4a%76%59%33%48%73%4a%73%63%77%49%35%37%70%33%78%48"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7830140"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jason_wang">jason_wang</a> 23 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7830140">link</a></span></div><br>

Each engineer has a role in building Course Hero's architecture and will have the opportunity to touch all parts of the stack. Our projects are big -- terabytes of data and customers around the world -- but our team is small, so you’ll see projects from start to finish, working closely with product managers and designers to ensure successful results.</p><p>Our company culture is very open, flat, and transparent. We succeed and learn together. Our office is very comfortable, has a lot of natural light, and great amenities like a gym and walking trails onsite. We’ve tried hard to make this a pleasant and inspiring place to do creative work.</p><p>Most importantly, we seek to hire individuals whose personality, integrity and passion for our business make our team better as a whole. We’re growing fast, profitable (yes, it’s true!), and looking for another core team member to push us toward the future.</p><p>Our stack is LAMP (PHP/Symfony) + jQuery and AngularJS, but we’re open to people with all kinds of experience. iOS would be a nice bonus.</p><p>More info: <a href="http://www.coursehero.com/jobs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.coursehero.com/jobs/</a> -

We're approaching a point where traditional university credentialing isn't enough. Skills are changing too quickly and what makes someone effective in a role or job is evolving.

Don’t let our name fool you, while our system is fun, our unique, patent-pending, technology is also deeply rooted in scientific modern testing theory.</p><p>Smarterer is enabling a revolution: in how the enterprise manages their teams and talent, in the changing job marketplace, and in the way people measure their own skills and share that knowledge.</p><p>We're funded by Google Ventures, True Ventures, Re-think education, Boston Seed as well as some amazing angel investors.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">Interested?

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Rinse - San Francisco, CA <a href="https://www.rinse.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.rinse.com</a><p>Despite the negative press recently, Laundry and Dry Cleaning really are problems that would benefit from today's technical prowess.  Modernizing laundry has real environmental benefits to water usage, not to mention the convenience factor of a delivery service.  As humanity becomes more and more urban and less and less likely to have space for a personal washer and dryer, demand for efficient laundry service is growing.</p><p>Rinse needs to tackle interesting technical challenges as well.  Of course, the routing problem as popularized by the Traveling Salesman Problem (except with multiple, load-balanced agents) is a challenge, but since we are also taking photos of the clothes we process, there are interesting data mining, machine learning, and image processing applications as well.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">San Francisco, CA OR Pittsburgh, PA OR Telecommute - Full Time<p>Stitch Fix is the first ecommerce brand to blend proprietary technology, unique product and human-powered design to deliver a shopping experience that is truly personalized for our clients.</p><p>Founded in 2011, we've grown from word-of-mouth and our leadership team includes former execs and engineers from Netflix, Polyvore, OPower, Baseline Ventures, and Uniqlo, among other leaders in the data and retailing fields.</p><p>We're building a Full Stack Startup to solve major challenges in ecommerce, apparel, merchandising, client experience, personal styling, inventory management and logistics, and we're set to double our engineering team of 9 in the next year.</p><p>If you want to come build new products and solve interesting problems with a great group of people, we're looking for more excited and talented individuals to join us.</p><p>More about our engineering team: 
We're working in a post-Agile process and are developing a distributed architecture of Rails applications (no monorails here) that not only help our clients, but also improve everything we do at Stitch Fix.</p><p>Our engineering and data science team is small, senior, and autonomous with no QA, product managers or project managers. We work with direct access to our clients and business data, and we communicate openly and transparently with the executive team.</p><p>We're working from San Francisco, Pittsburgh and remotely and we rely on collaborative communication and dev tools like GitHub, HipChat, Google Hangouts and Heroku to get it all done.</p><p>The Role: 
We're looking for a Sr. Full Stack Engineer to join our team. We're building a new kind of enterprise, service-oriented set of applications that's powering one of the most innovative ecommerce platforms ever.</p><p>Here are some things we're working on: 
* Advanced learning algorithms to aid our awesome styling team 
* Multiple-application architecture running in the cloud 
* Custom warehouse and inventory systems for a very unique business model 
* Responsive web interfaces to drive both the customer experience and our internal tools 
* Building prediction models for a smart and successful future</p><p>We build through open communication, collaboration, prototyping and testing. We work mostly in Rails with some Python. We love HipChat and Google Hangouts. We use new continuous integration tools like Tddium to deploy to Heroku.</p><p>Our Ideal Candidate: 
Is someone who's developed a couple solid Rails and other MVC-framework web applications as part of a collaborative team.</p><p>We're especially looking for lead engineers who can demonstrate aptitude in the following skills: 
* Real tech fluency: You can build anything with anything, and you probably have 5+ years of software development experience with a couple of those years working in Ruby on Rails. 
* Communication skills: You aren't just great at listening, speaking and writing. You are able to convey complex ideas and information regardless of the medium or situation. 
* Product-Centric Thinking: You come from a tech background but you have opinions about how the product you're building should work. You dig deep and work with customers, the company and our executive team to uncover the ideal way to leverage technology to solve problems. 
* Self-Directed: Once you've got something, we don't have to worry about it. You have a bias toward action. Our team doesn't have QA, project managers or product managers so we take ownership of what we build. 
* Passion: You love what you do and can share side projects or open source contributions with a GitHub repository, personal project page or blog. 
* Just Generally Awesome: You take your work seriously but not yourself. You show everyone respect regardless of the circumstance. Extra points if we think you're funny or if you're already a Stitch Fix superfan!</p><p>Bonus Points For: 
* Experience working collaboratively as a team. We use GitHub, Heroku and HipChat to get stuff done. We're agnostic about what you've used (and no judging if you're more into BitBucket) and are more interested in the process you like to use. 
* Experience working with testing and continuous integration. We're working with the usual Ruby gems like Rspec, Capybara and others for unit and feature tests, Tddium for CI and RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging. 
* Experience using pull requests to create rapid prototypes and new features. If we like what you make (and if you like what we're making), we agree to merge it to production! 
* Unique ways to automate and get things done. For example, if you've created a Ruby gem to complete a task in your projects, tell us about it! :)</p><p>We knew you'd ask eventually, so here's what we're offering: 
* Competitive salaries and generous equity. 
* A business that trusts and embraces tech. We know, a style brand? But it's totally true. 
* Want to move to San Francisco or Pittsburgh? Stitch Fix has your relocation expenses covered. 
* A senior team that does things right. 
* A startup with a proven business model that's growing fast. 
* Use your preference of tools and hardware. 
* A comprehensive health insurance plan, including full dental and vision coverage. 
* Fully stocked pantry with your choice of snacks and drinks. 
* Sunny office in downtown San Francisco and also in downtown Pittsburgh (or you can come visit our SF office once every 2 months if you prefer to work remotely)</p></font><p><font color="#000000">How To Apply

We built Sooloos because we wanted its features for ourselves: the ability to browse huge music libraries and stream audio to multiple rooms. We built touchscreen kiosks and put them in our friends' houses and in our favorite bars. We kept our day jobs, but in our own time we relentlessly pursued the world's coolest music listening experience.</p><p>After a few years, we were surprised that other products in the space were still unable to meet our needs, so we turned our hobby into a company and shipped our first product in 2006. We built our own hardware using studio-grade audio components and packaged Sooloos as a high-end music server for the audiophile market, which received us with open arms.</p><p>In late 2008 we were acquired by Meridian Audio, which had a culture of innovation in audio hardware and DSP that matched our own in UX and streaming. In addition to manufacturing the gold standard of high-performance multi-zone music solutions, we also develop software music products for Jaguar Land Rover, Hewlett Packard, and a variety of audio OEMs.</p><p>Five years post acquisition, everyone on our original development team is still with us. Our reference product serves a community of 10,000 specialty users, and we have 10 million activations and 1.5 million monthly actives for HP Connected Music, the product we bundle on nearly 20 million PCs annually. We work with the biggest services in the business including Last.fm, AllMusic Guide, Rhapsody, Deezer, TuneIn, iHeart Radio, Spotify, 7digital, Songkick, Musicbrainz, LyricFind, and Qobuz.</p><p>Our team is headquartered in Meridian's New York office in Soho (home to the most amazing digital theater ever) but we routinely work remotely, sometimes on four continents at once. Our flat structure relies on the initiative and accountability of everyone on the team; we all own projects (and in some cases product) and our output speaks for itself.</p></font><p><font color="#000000">Please contact hiring@sooloos.com if you're interested</font></p><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./index2_files/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7830987" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7830987&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%76%4c%38%48%61%4a%76%59%33%48%73%4a%73%63%77%49%35%37%70%33%78%48"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7830987"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jack7890">jack7890</a> 23 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7830987">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Expensify-San Francisco, CA-Fulltime, Programmer Extraordinaire<p>Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do "expense reports that don't suck!" (Google "expensify" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:</p><p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.</p><p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?</p></font><p><font color="#000000">There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href="http://we.are.expensify.com/apply" rel="nofollow">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).

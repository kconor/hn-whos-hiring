<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Where are we?<p>- Doesn’t matter - you can work from your preferred location. But in case you’re wondering, we’re in Hattiesburg, MS.</p><p>Who are we?</p><p>- <a href="http://www.schoolstatus.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.schoolstatus.com</a></p><p>- SchoolStatus is a data framework for the K-12 education industry that combines a school district's disjointed data systems into one easily-accessed location. Our web-based interface allows educators to make data-driven decisions - regardless of previous technology experience. We also provide a mechanism for principals to deliver evaluation measures to teachers for real-time classroom feedback.</p><p>- Our backend engine provides mechanisms for automated data retrieval and sanitation, allowing the customer’s data to remain fresh with no interaction needed.</p><p>- Launched in January 2013, we’ve quickly become the data solution for roughly 50% of Mississippi public school districts and are currently migrating into other states.  We’ve been revenue-driven and maintain profitability, which has made us attractive to potential funding sources and we’re currently considering our options.</p><p>Who are you?</p><p>- You are a talented, enthusiastic programmer that can’t wait to assist in the development of our backend engine and front-end interfaces.  Our core technologies include:</p><p>* Ruby as primary language on backend.  Due to lack of APIs on many third-party educational systems, data retrieval is often performed by various scraping methods.  Experience with Mechanize, Nokogiri, Watir, and the likes are the icing on your cake.</p><p>* Ruby’s Padrino, a highly extensible framework built on Sinatra, is the glue connecting our backend to frontend.</p><p>* MongoDB, Redis, Postgresql, Elasticsearch, and Amazon Redshift provide our various data stores.</p><p>* Objective-C/UIKit powers our teacher evaluation instrument for iPad and you are totally okay with that.</p><p>* Angular.js on the frontend is something that makes you smile. Data visualizations created with Highcharts, D3, and Charts.js.</p><p>* By no means are we limited to the languages and technologies above.  Solutions from other areas are always welcome - as long as they play nice with others (Flash.)</p><p>What will we give you?</p><p>- Competitive salary with full health, vision, and dental benefits.</p><p>- Retirement plan (comparable to the big guys that have way more meetings) with company match that will make sure your cohabitating hamsters are well-cared for in their old age.</p><p>- Flexible vacation structure (meaning just tell us you’re going out of town), including a company-provided condominium in Florida.  Yes, we have a condo.</p><p>What will you give us?</p><p>- Loyalty to the company goals as a whole and a desire to serve the greater good.</p><p>- Flexibility to perform outside of your specific role when it’s needed, included talking with customers and attending trade shows from time to time.</p><p>- A good sense of humor - because nobody likes a boring job.</p><p>----</p></font><p><font color="#000000">Contact us with questions, resume/CV, or portfolio at hack@schoolstatus.com</font></p><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./index3_files/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7830263" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7830263&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6b%71%75%78%76%36%75%6e%45%62%32%61%46%64%66%30%6f%75%41%56%6d%52"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7830263"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=stevewilhelm">stevewilhelm</a> 23 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7830263">link</a></span></div><br>

You test, refactor, and love your code.
You write killer back-end code, but don’t shy away from the front-end.</p><p>&gt;&gt; WHO ARE WE?</p><p>Before any meeting, Charlie automatically researches people before you see them. Researching people is a complex problem: we sift through, analyze, and manipulate data into powerful insights (i.e. what are they passionate about, what do you have in common?). CNBC called us “One of the world’s most promising new companies” and SXSW selected us as an Accelerator Finalist.</p><p>We’ve built Charlie to research people at massive scale, using the latest Ruby on Rails stack with MongoDB, Redis, Sidekiq, and hosted in an elastic cloud farm. We write code with agility and have a tight process where anyone on the team can deploy to production at any time, without approval. We thoroughly test our code, though we’re not strict TDD. We have a small dev team where everyone loves to code, are passionate about Charlie, and push-and learn from each other on a daily basis.</p><p>This is your opportunity to join an early-stage company that’s making moves.

This means people look for work longer, companies move slower, and products and services that we all want don't get delivered. Recruiting is a $400 billion per year industry, and there is ample room to make it better. Connectifier is a small but quickly growing venture-backed startup that’s passionate about solving the hiring problem. We build software to streamline the recruiting process and connect talented candidates with the companies looking to hire them. Join us to be an early employee at a fast growing startup!</p><p>Our engineering team has a depth of talent from places like Google, Microsoft Research, Berkeley National Lab, Carnegie Mellon, and Stanford. We’re committed to helping each other learn and grow while having a blast, and we’re looking for developers that are smart, ambitious, and get things done. We mostly work in Java, but you’ll get bonus points for server/backend, MongoDB, HTML, JavaScript, or machine learning experience. You’ll get to design and develop large scale data processing systems, work alongside a talented set of peers, and make an impact beyond what is possible at a large, bureaucratic company.</p><p>We offer a highly competitive salary and stock compensation package, including 100% employee coverage for medical, dental, life, and disability insurance. We also provide lunch and a fully-stocked snack bar &amp; coffee station. To decompress, we play table tennis at the office, or volleyball at the beach (which is walking distance from our office!).</p></font><p><font color="#000000">Placing the right people in the right jobs is hard, and since we took on this challenge, we've already helped hundreds of companies, from fledgling startups to the Fortune 100s, find and recruit the best talent.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Location: San Fransisco, CA<p>Aclima is an early-stage company based in San Francisco that designs and deploys distributed, large-scale sensor networks to empower people with actionable environmental quality data. Our end-to-end solutions collect, process and analyze real-time streaming data from thousands of sensors, enabling a level of environmental awareness that has never been possible before. We believe our technologies can redefine the way we imagine and manage our buildings, communities, and cities, helping us improve our collective well-being. 
We are looking for passionate engineers to help build and scale our platform.  We have no required list of skills or years of experience.  Instead, we’re looking for engineers who are smart and get things done.  Python experience will come in handy, though, as well as experience with large-scale distributed system development.  Our engineering culture values rapid iteration, continuous improvement, and as much automation as is sensible.  We work in a relaxed, purpose-driven atmosphere with flexible hours and competitive perks.</p><p>Our stack includes:  Python 2.7, Git, MariaDB, Cassandra, Nginx, NSQ, Redis, Ansible</p></font><p><font color="#000000">If you’re up for the challenge, contact us: jobs@aclima.io</font></p><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></p></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./index3_files/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7829127" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?for=7829127&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6b%71%75%78%76%36%75%6e%45%62%32%61%46%64%66%30%6f%75%41%56%6d%52"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7829127"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=egwor">egwor</a> 23 days ago  | <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7829127">link</a></span></div><br>
